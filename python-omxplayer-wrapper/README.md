> Control OMXPlayer from Python on the Raspberry Pi.

## Install
Make sure dbus is installed:
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install python-dbus
```

For someone who just wants to use the package:
```shell
$ python setup.py install
```

If you're feeling helpful, and decide to help develop the package:
```shell
$ python setup.py develop
```
There's also an Ansible playbook in `devenv` which will set up a raspberry pi
with omxplayer-wrapper in develop mode (located at
`/usr/src/omxplayer-wrapper`) which can be used by running `./devenv/deploy.sh`

This will install via symlinks so that you can continue to work on it locally
but import it from other python packages

## Hello world
```python
from omxplayer import OMXPlayer
from time import sleep

file_path_or_url = 'path/to/file.mp4'

# This will start an `omxplayer` process, this might
# fail the first time you run it, currently in the
# process of fixing this though.
player = OMXPlayer(file_path_or_url)

player.pause()
sleep(5)
player.play()

# Kill the `omxplayer` process gracefully.
player.quit()
```

Playing a stream from a URL (e.g. a live RTMP or RTSP stream) works the same as with a file path, just change the "source" string parameter given to `OMXPlayer` to a URL instead of a file path.
```python
from omxplayer import OMXPlayer
from time import sleep

file_path_or_url = 'rtmp://192.168.0.1/live/test'

player = OMXPlayer(file_path_or_url)

player.pause()
sleep(5)
player.play()

# Kill the `omxplayer` process gracefully.
player.quit()
```

Playing several instances of omxplayer simultaneously
```python
from omxplayer import OMXPlayer

# Use default dbus name for first instance
player1 = OMXPlayer(file_path_or_url1, pause=True)
# Name of dbus for second instance is just an example
player2 = OMXPlayer(file_path_or_url2, dbus_name='org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.omxplayer1', pause=True)

# Players are initially paused due to the 'pause' argument, but this is not necessary
# That way we can start them synchronously
player1.play()
player2.play()

# Kill the `omxplayer` processes gracefully.
player1.quit()
player2.quit()
```

## Usage patterns
*Choppy streaming over a slow connection?* If you're connection isn't good
enough to support streaming, checkout `urllib2` to download the file locally
prior to playing.
